				<div class="fusion-text">
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Are inflatables safe?<br />
							A: </strong><span style="color: green;">Absolutely!</span> As long as all the rules outlined in
						the Rental Agreement are followed, and the unit is supervised at
						all times, they are very safe. We will request your signature on
						this form and give you a copy on the day of the delivery.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: How safe are your inflatables?<br />
							A: </strong>Our inflatables are constructed with quality and
						safety in mind! All of our units have a <span style="color: orange;">safety entrance/exit</span>
						ramp for the children's protection and safety and
						emergency exit flaps in the roof. Each unit is constructed of
						only the very best American made commercial grade 18 to 21 oz.
						vinyl, with double and quadruple stitching. All of the materials
						are <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">fire retardant</span>. The windows of the bounces are
						made of specially designed mesh netting, which allows for easy viewing
						and minimizes the chances of getting entangled. We securely stake
						the base of all inflatables into the ground. Four 50-200 lb. sand
						bags secured within commercial-grade duffle bags are used for surfaces
						such as packed gravel, cement or asphalt where stakes cannot be used.
						Each of our inflatables is equipped with a non-removable list of rules.
						We will also supply <span style="color: orange;">recommended guidelines</span> for safe use and
						the recommended number of children allowed in the inflatable at any one time.
						Beware of cheap, unsafe, imitation inflatables!</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Do you have insurance?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes. Uganda Bounce House Rentals, LLC is fully <span style="color: green;">licensed
							and insured</span> for rentals that we set up.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: What are my responsibilities as the renter of the moon
							bounce?<br />
							A: </strong>A responsible adult must be assigned to
						supervise all activity in and around the inflatable while it is
						in use. The responsible adult must know and enforce all the
						safety rules. The renter is responsible for the safety of all
						participants and the care of the equipment.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: How does the inflatable unit stay inflated?<br />
							A: </strong>We set up the unit and inflate the bounce or
						slide with a fully enclosed <span style="color: orange;">blower motor</span> that must stay on the
						entire time that the inflatable unit is being used (unless winds
						exceed 25 mph or it starts to rain, in which case the motor must
						be shut down). There are no moving parts exposed on the blower
						unit, which is a very important safety feature when there are
						children around. The blower unit must be located within 100 feet
						of an electrical outlet.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Who sets up the inflatable?<br />
							A: </strong>We set up the bounce or slide and take it down
						when we come to pick it up. This is done to ensure your safety
						and the safety of the equipment. Set up time is approximately 20
						minutes for the bounces and 25-30 minutes for the combos and
						slides. We ask that if you are done with the bounce or slide
						please shut down the blower. The inflatable must be inflated
						before it is taken down so that we can inspect and do a cleaning
						of the unit. We ask that if you use the slide as a <span style="color: orange;">WATER SLIDE</span>
						that you wash any mud from the unit, turn the water off, and
						empty the pool one hour before we arrive. Please LEAVE THE WATER
						UNITS INFLATED, so that it may be dry when we pick it up. This
						hour will not be included in your rental time.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: What time do you deliver and pick up the
							inflatable?<br />
							A: </strong>We create our delivery schedule based on party
						times the day before delivery. We will call prior to the
						delivery date and make sure our time works with your plans. In
						order to ensure that everyone has the maximum rental time, we
						deliver and pick up in the same order. We will be there anywhere
						from 1 to 3 hours before your party time for set up. You do not
						pay for setup or take downtime. Your rental period is for a day,
						6 hours, or more depending on the pick-up schedule. Overnight setups
						are available for an additional charge. We pick up the unit
						after the party is over, but please allow up to 3 hours for pick
						up. If an exact delivery or pick-up time is needed, just let us
						know. We will be more than happy to make any arrangements
						that you may need.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: How much room do I need?<br />
							A: </strong>Approximately a <span style="color: orange;">20' by 20'</span> area
						should be plenty of room for the bounce houses and a <span style="color: orange;">20' by 40'</span>
						area for the slide. We also need to consider
						vertical clearance which will be between 18 – 22 feet high. The
						area should be level, free of rocks, sticks, animal droppings,
						etc. and any in-ground sprinkler systems should be shut off and
						not sticking up. Please make us aware if you have a sprinkler
						system. The unit should be within 100 feet of an electrical
						outlet. The hose is not provided for water units. You will need
						to have enough hose to reach the Slide. The inflatables can also
						be used indoors. Please specify which surface the inflatable is
						to be set up on, so that we can provide the appropriate anchors.
						Please clean and clear the area for the inflatable prior to our
						arrival time.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Do you set it up in parks?<br />
							A: </strong>You will be responsible for obtaining any
						necessary permits. A generator may need to be used as well, for
						not all park locations have electricity. We can provide a
						generator for an additional cost.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can your inflatables be set up indoors?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, our inflatables can be set up indoors.
						Please make sure that the facility has adequate space and
						ceiling height for the inflatable. Some facilities may require
						additional insurance or inspections. It is the responsibility
						of the customer to check with the facility regarding any
						requirements. Please inform us if you plan to set up the
						inflatable indoors so that we can provide the appropriate
						anchors.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Do you require a deposit?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, we require a $50 deposit to reserve the
						inflatable. The remaining balance is due on the day of the
						rental, prior to set up.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: What is your cancellation policy?<br />
							A: </strong>Our cancellation policy is as follows: Cancellations
						due to weather are accepted up to the day of delivery and do
						not incur any fees. For other cancellations, please let us know
						as soon as possible. If you cancel more than 7 days before your
						rental, your deposit will be refunded. If you cancel within 7
						days of your rental, the deposit is non-refundable. Once we
						arrive and set up, the full rental fee is due, even if the
						inflatable is not used. There are no refunds for unused time.
						Please note that we reserve the right to cancel your rental
						reservation at any time due to severe weather conditions (rain,
						high winds, etc.).</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: What forms of payment do you accept?<br />
							A: </strong>We accept cash and credit card payments. If you
						are paying by cash, please have the exact amount ready, as our
						drivers do not carry change. Credit card payments can be made
						over the phone or in person upon delivery. Personal checks are
						not accepted.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Is a generator included with the inflatable rental?<br />
							A: </strong>No, the generator is not included with the
						inflatable rental. If your event is in a location without access
						to electrical power, you will need to rent a generator separately.
						We can provide a generator for an additional cost.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can adults use the inflatables?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, most of our inflatables are suitable for both
						children and adults. However, there are weight and height
						restrictions for each unit, so please check the product
						description or ask us for details.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can you provide an attendant to supervise the inflatable?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, we can provide an attendant for an additional
						fee. An attendant is recommended, especially for large events
						with a high number of participants, to ensure the safety of all
						users.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can I move the inflatable once it is set up?<br />
							A: </strong>No, once the inflatable is set up, it cannot be
						moved. It is important to choose the setup location carefully
						before we arrive. Moving the inflatable after setup poses safety
						risks and is not allowed.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: What happens if it rains?<br />
							A: </strong>We understand that weather conditions can be
						unpredictable. If rain is forecasted, we will contact you a day
						before the rental to discuss options. In case of rain during the
						rental period, you have the option to cancel before the
						inflatable is set up, and your deposit will be refunded. Once
						set up, the full rental fee is due, even if the inflatable is
						not used. There are no refunds for unused time.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Are there any cleaning fees?<br />
							A: </strong>No, there are no additional cleaning fees if the
						inflatable is returned in a reasonable condition. However, if
						excessive cleaning is required due to misuse (e.g., food, drink,
						or other stains), an additional cleaning fee may apply.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can I decorate the inflatable?<br />
							A: </strong>Small, removable decorations are generally
						allowed. However, please avoid using tape or any adhesive
						materials directly on the inflatable, as they can damage the
						surface. If you have specific decoration plans, please discuss
						them with us beforehand.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Is there an age limit for using the inflatables?<br />
							A: </strong>Our inflatables are designed for various age
						groups. Please check the product description for age
						recommendations. It is important to ensure that children are
						grouped appropriately to prevent injuries and ensure a safe
						play environment.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: How do I secure a reservation?<br />
							A: </strong>To secure a reservation, we require a $50
						deposit. You can make a deposit by contacting us directly.
						Please note that reservations are on a first-come, first-served
						basis, so it's recommended to book well in advance of your
						event date.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: What if I need to cancel my reservation?<br />
							A: </strong>If you need to cancel your reservation due to
						unforeseen circumstances, please notify us as soon as possible.
						Cancellations made more than 7 days before the rental date will
						receive a refund of the deposit. Cancellations within 7 days of
						the rental date will result in the loss of the deposit.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can I extend the rental period?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, you may extend the rental period if the
						inflatable is available. Please contact us as soon as possible
						to make arrangements. Additional charges may apply for extended
						rental periods.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Can I book multiple inflatables for the same event?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, you can book multiple inflatables for the
						same event, subject to availability. Booking multiple units
						often results in discounted rates. Contact us for more
						information and to customize your rental package.</p>
				
					<p><strong style="color: blue;">Q: Do you offer discounts for multiple-day rentals?<br />
							A: </strong>Yes, we offer discounts for multiple-day rentals.
						Contact us to discuss your specific needs, and we will provide
						pricing information based on the duration of your rental.</p>
